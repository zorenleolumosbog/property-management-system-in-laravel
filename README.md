# Laravel Property Management System Project

This Property Management System Project in Laravel is created in Laravel Framework. This project aims to improve property management transactions by implementing a content management system that could easily update information on the company’s website.

To give their consumers with the information they require, the organization now uses a static website. The difficulty with a static website is that you have to change and update the code base or source code every time you add or amend material.

This method can only be used by people who are familiar with coding and programming. With this type of situation, the organization opted to upgrade their current system.
